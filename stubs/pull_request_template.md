## Name
Generally the default <yourname>/<your-feature> is just fine for the PR name.

## Prerequisites
* Is my PR ready? Use Draft PRs if you need extra time to put together a good PR.
* Is my PR massive? Can I break things down a bit to make it easier to merge?
* Have I written tests that cover the changes?
* Are my tests passing both locally and in GitHub Actions on my branch?
* Have I fully reviewed my changes, ensuring I am committing only what is absolutely necessary? (No commented out code, follows guidelines)

## Description
Write a succinct summary of your PR. Focus on:
* What problems are you solving?
* What was the catalyst for this PR? (links to basecamp ad-hoc)
* Is this a feature or a bug fix?
* Is this a breaking change?
* What are you unsure about?

Don't focus on:
* Granular information about the exact code that was written
* Granular information about files that were changed

## Wrapping Up
Have I moved my to-do item to the Review column in Basecamp?
Have I commented in my To-Do a link to the PR?
